This Streamlit web application allows users to input patient health details (such as age, cholesterol level, chest pain type, etc.) and predicts whether the patient is likely to have heart disease using a trained machine learning model. The model was built using a Random Forest Classifier and trained on a publicly available heart disease dataset. The app performs preprocessing, scaling, and prediction all in real time.
